# eliu.sh
### Introducing the all new, the all colorful...

![Demo](demo.png)

### My personal website, reimagined and reinvented for the terminal. 

To view the site, simply run:
```bash
curl eliu.sh
```

To see all available endpoints for curling, simple run:
```bash
curl eliu.sh/menu
```


## Requirements
The terminal must support true color (24-bit), or else some colors will not be shown correctly.
